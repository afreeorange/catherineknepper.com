<h3 id="writer-editor-publishing-consultant">Writer. Editor. Publishing Consultant.</h3>
<p>I began editing in 2003 while I was completing my MFA at the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, became a full-time editor in 2005, and in 2009 launched my own editing and writing business. I’ve worked with hundreds of authors in dozens of genres, collaborated on ten books, written book proposals, articles, speeches, op-eds, and book marketing material, and cultivated relationships with many of the top literary agents in the business. The Writers’ Workshop taught me a great deal about the creative side of writing, but it was working as an editor and collaborator that taught me the business of publishing. As a writer with experience on both sides of the desk, I’m in a unique position to help you make your book a work of creative and commercial success.</p>
<p>I hold degrees in English literature and philosophy &#x26; religion (B.A.), theology (M.Div.), and fiction (MFA). I’ve also done fiction-writing courses through the Harvard Extension School and Boston’s Grub Street Writers. Along the way I’ve judged writing contests and vetted submissions for <a href="https://agnionline.bu.edu/"><em>AGNI</em></a> and <a href="http://iowareview.uiowa.edu/"><em>The Iowa Review</em></a>, and every now and again I get around to my own writing. My fiction has appeared in <a href="http://westbranch.blogs.bucknell.edu/"><em>West Branch</em></a>, <a href="http://floridareview.cah.ucf.edu/"><em>The Florida Review</em></a>, <a href="http://memorious.org/"><em>Memorious</em></a>, <a href="http://www.necessaryfiction.com/"><em>Necessary Fiction</em></a>, <a href="http://www.readmeridian.org/"><em>Meridian</em></a>, <a href="http://confrontationmagazine.org/fiction-from-issue-123/"><em>Confrontation</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.mainereview.com/"><em>The Maine Review</em></a>.</p>
<p>I’m based in Des Moines, Iowa, where I do my best to keep up with two teenagers and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lunabear_the_husky_/">a rescue husky named Luna</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Catherine served as a fabulous, much-needed second reader on my (rather long and complicated) novel, <em>Cloud Cuckoo Land</em>. She helped me tighten language, repair chronological wrinkles, clarify muddled passages, and even invent some terminology. And she served as an essential sounding board for all sorts of revision ideas. Most importantly, Catherine helped me stay confident and buoyant when I was exhausted from the work of assembling the book. I wholeheartedly recommend her services.</p>

<p>There are editors, and there are editors. And then – I kid you not – there are EDITORS. I’ve worked with a lot of editors. All kinds. Heck, I’m an editor. Catherine Knepper is damn near peerless. Fiction or nonfiction; it matters not. She’s the kind of editor that editors want to work on their prose. It won’t be easy to get on her schedule but if you get the chance, grab it with both hands and hold on for a wild ride.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Catherine is truly lovely to work with. She immediately made me feel very comfortable, making it easy to share my story. She immersed herself in my personal journey, and her ability to take my life and put it down on paper in a way that is completely authentic and genuine is so impressive. She captured my voice and translated it to a story that reads so beautifully - exactly what I wanted to say, but better.</p>

<p>It’s with full confidence and inspiration that I recommend Catherine Knepper. As a second-time author working with Harvard Business Review Press, I knew I needed someone who could deliver a high-quality, no nonsense, practical manuscript for a business audience and be able to do that in a way which also captured my natural style, authenticity, and voice as an executive coach. From the outset, I noticed Catherine’s rigor in how she approached really understanding the publisher I was working with and the reader I was writing for. Her level of commitment only continued as we spent months working together to transform outlines, drafts, research, and interviews into a fully realized manuscript. Catherine is a gifted writer and fully brought to life my voice and message. In every page, you see where she has enhanced my thinking, considered the reader’s point of view, or has integrated important research by selecting the right information, paraphrasing exactly what is needed, and footnoting all with precision.</p>
<p>On top of producing an outstanding, quality end product, Catherine is an absolute joy to work with! She is authentic, positive, and encouraging all along the way, which offers an author a sense of important ease during a process which can bring high stress and tight deadlines. As I look back on my work with Catherine I’ll forever be grateful for her being there every step of the way-not only in my being able to turn in my manuscript to Harvard Business Press ahead of schedule but also for making it a fun and wonderful experience overall!</p>

<p>I have no doubt my book would not have been the success it is without Catherine’s editorial help. This was a challenging piece and I had fast deadlines, but she immediately understood my objectives and voice, and was able to quickly identify smart solutions on exactly how to move it forward. She breathed new vision into my manuscript in just a few short weeks.</p>
<p>Catherine puts great dedication and care into her work. She spends the time to do what’s best for her clients, and handled my writing with an incredible amount of thoughtfulness. There is no doubt Catherine is in your court. She gave me the direct feedback I needed, and set me on a smart path forward. Working with Catherine on my manuscript was one of the most enjoyable projects I’ve experienced over a decades-long career.</p>

<p>Catherine Knepper is a dream of an editor. She excels at both diagnosing the problem and figuring out a way forward. This combination is extremely rare: it takes special skill to understand not only what a writing project is, but what it might be. What’s especially wonderful about Catherine is that she is able to explain both what is wrong and what is right in a clear, supportive manner. I’d recommend her to any writer who wants a super-smart, talented, warm and professional editor who is both thorough and creative. She is the real deal, and seeing her work left me with just one word - wow.</p>

<p>It was a magical experience working with Catherine Knepper. It began with a finely-tuned book proposal and finished with a 334-page product, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/598034/heal-your-heart-by-michael-miller/9781623363635/"><em>Heal Your Heart: The Positive Emotions Prescription to Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease</em></a>, in an insanely short period (4 months!). Catherine interviewed many of my patients, all of whom loved speaking with her and sharing their stories, and converted dull medical material into an interesting ’<a href="https://www.facebook.com/healyourheartbook">page turner</a>.’ Perhaps my editor summed it up best by stating that this was the most complete manuscript she had ever received.</p>

<p>It seemed like I met a soul mate when Catherine and I talked for the first time about co-writing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Against-The-Wind-Kirk-VanHee/dp/1482061252"><em>Against the Wind</em></a>. I was looking for someone to understand me and the age that I grew up in, the 60’s and 70’s. I assumed it was going to be a male Boomer who’d lived through those days. It wasn’t as I thought-I found a real treasure of talent and understanding in Catherine. Catherine was intrigued by my story of redemption and said she would give it a try for a chapter or two. We worked through those first chapters and from there we both became a part of this great book. Thank you, Catherine, as you have touched my soul and so many readers who have read our book!</p>

<p>The idea to write a book came after 12+ years of running our own business. We had a genuine desire to share what we had learned with the next generation of entrepreneurs. We quickly learned that tackling this alone was not feasible, so after numerous interviews and false starts we were referred to Catherine Knepper. After the first interview we knew the search was over. Catherine has been exceptional to work with in every respect imaginable and has exceeded our expectations every step of the way. If you are looking for a ghostwriter look no further, Catherine is the best of the best.</p>

<p>I work with traditionally and independently published authors, and offer a range of customized editorial and writing services that help make your writing project a creative and commercial success. I take particular care to preserve your unique vision, voice, tone, and style. Final approval for edits is always up to you.</p>
<h3 id="content-editing">Content Editing</h3>
<h4 id="manuscript-coaching--line-editing--developmental-editing">Manuscript coaching + line editing + developmental editing</h4>
<p>My take on Content Editing is a little unconventional, but it’s evolved over the years and has proven very popular with clients. This hybrid approach allows me to do it all: provide applause, constructive feedback, line-by-line editing, and suggestions and solutions on a granular as well as a global level.</p>
<p>What you’ll receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>A real-time, informal reaction to your writing. I first engage with your book as a reader. I highlight what’s working well and why, pose queries, and identify areas that call for revision or further development. Emojis are used liberally. 😉</li>
<li>Detailed, line-by-line editing. Here’s where I don my editing hat and provide sentence-level editing that enhances your book’s flow, syntax, and clarity.</li>
<li>A careful, considered response to your manuscript. More akin to the traditional editorial letter, this global feedback provides you with an assessment of the book’s overall strengths and weaknesses, along with specific suggestions and solutions for revision.</li>
</ul>
<p>After I submit first-pass edits to you, you’ll have a chance to incorporate feedback and revise on your own. You’ll then send the revised manuscript back to me for a final round of editing, which includes a copy edit. <mark>The fee for this service is $16 per page (1 page = 250 words).</mark></p>
<h3 id="line-editing">Line Editing</h3>
<h4 id="intensive-line-by-line-feedback-and-editing">Intensive, line-by-line feedback and editing</h4>
<p>I provide sentence-level editing that enhances your book’s flow, syntax, and clarity. The goal of line editing is to leave you with a polished, publication-ready manuscript. <mark>My rates start at $12 per page (1 page = 250 words).</mark></p>
<h3 id="developmental-editing">Developmental Editing</h3>
<h4 id="overall-content-feedback-and-revision-strategy">Overall content feedback and revision strategy</h4>
<p>Developmental editing assesses big-picture matters such as structure, organization, flow, pacing, plot, characterization, voice, tone, and consistency. I’ll provide you with a detailed editorial letter that identifies your book’s overall strengths and weaknesses, and guides you through the revision process using specific suggestions and solutions. <mark>Rates begin at $10 per page (1 page = 250 words).</mark></p>
<h3 id="book-proposal-preparation">Book Proposal Preparation</h3>
<h4 id="content-strategy-and-marketing-for-nonfiction-authors-seeking-traditional-publication">Content strategy and marketing for nonfiction authors seeking traditional publication</h4>
<p>The good news for nonfiction authors who want to publish with a trade publisher is that books are sold on proposal, rather than a completed manuscript. My Book Proposal Preparation service gives you a competitive proposal that’s ready to submit to literary agents, acquisitions editors, and publishing houses. Components include:</p>
<div class="scrunched">
<ul>
<li>Your overview and hook</li>
<li>Author bio</li>
<li>Full marketing plan</li>
<li>Competitive analysis</li>
<li>Table of contents and chapter summaries</li>
<li>1-3 sample chapters</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><mark>My rates start at $9,000. <em>To date, every client whose proposal has sold has recouped the cost of editing with their advance.</em> </mark></p>
<h3 id="manuscript-collaboration--ghostwriting--nonfiction-only">Manuscript Collaboration &#x26; Ghostwriting <br> (nonfiction only)</h3>
<p>If you have a great idea for a book but don’t have the time, writing experience, or inclination to write it, let’s work together to create a bestseller. You can write as much or as little as you like: I’ve worked with authors who provided 30 pages of content per chapter to authors who left all the writing and research to me (and everything in between).</p>
<p>I’ve written books in as little as four months, but generally, you should set aside around six months for the production of a manuscript of 60,000 – 80,000 words, and slightly longer if you’d like a book proposal as well. Book Proposal Preparation + Manuscript Collaboration packages are available.</p>
<p>My rates are on the higher end of the professional ghostwriting scale, but can vary widely depending on the amount of work involved, the delivery deadline, and other negotiable terms such as profit-sharing and byline. (I do not require a byline and am happy to sign an NDA.) <mark>Please contact me for details and I’ll provide you with a proposal outlining terms of service, deliverables, and fees.<mark></mark></mark></p>
<h3 id="consultation-hours">Consultation Hours</h3>
<p>For writing or editing short works (articles, op-eds, chapters, query letters, etc.), or to consult me on matters related to publishing, <mark>I offer an hourly rate of $150.</mark></p>  </main> </section> <section id="contact" data-name="contact"> <main>  <h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>
