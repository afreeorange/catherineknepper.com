### Writer. Editor. Publishing Consultant.

I began editing in 2003 while I was completing my MFA at the Iowa Writers' Workshop, became a full-time editor in 2005, and in 2009 launched my own editing and writing business. I've worked with hundreds of authors in dozens of genres, collaborated on ten books, written book proposals, articles, speeches, op-eds, and book marketing material, and cultivated relationships with many of the top literary agents in the business. The Writers' Workshop taught me a great deal about the creative side of writing, but it was working as an editor and collaborator that taught me the business of publishing. As a writer with experience on both sides of the desk, I'm in a unique position to help you make your book a work of creative and commercial success.

I hold degrees in English literature and philosophy & religion (B.A.), theology (M.Div.), and fiction (MFA). I've also done fiction-writing courses through the Harvard Extension School and Boston's Grub Street Writers. Along the way I've judged writing contests and vetted submissions for [_AGNI_](https://agnionline.bu.edu/) and [_The Iowa Review_](http://iowareview.uiowa.edu/), and every now and again I get around to my own writing. My fiction has appeared in [_West Branch_](http://westbranch.blogs.bucknell.edu/), [_The Florida Review_](http://floridareview.cah.ucf.edu/), [_Memorious_](http://memorious.org/), [_Necessary Fiction_](http://www.necessaryfiction.com/), [_Meridian_](http://www.readmeridian.org/), [_Confrontation_](http://confrontationmagazine.org/fiction-from-issue-123/), and [_The Maine Review_](https://www.mainereview.com/).

I'm based in Des Moines, Iowa, where I do my best to keep up with two teenagers and [a rescue husky named Luna](https://www.instagram.com/lunabear_the_husky_/).
