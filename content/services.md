I work with traditionally and independently published authors, and offer a range of customized editorial and writing services that help make your writing project a creative and commercial success. I take particular care to preserve your unique vision, voice, tone, and style. Final approval for edits is always up to you.

### Content Editing

#### Manuscript coaching + line editing + developmental editing

My take on Content Editing is a little unconventional, but it's evolved over the years and has proven very popular with clients. This hybrid approach allows me to do it all: provide applause, constructive feedback, line-by-line editing, and suggestions and solutions on a granular as well as a global level.

What you'll receive:

* A real-time, informal reaction to your writing. I first engage with your book as a reader. I highlight what's working well and why, pose queries, and identify areas that call for revision or further development. Emojis are used liberally. ðŸ˜‰
* Detailed, line-by-line editing. Here's where I don my editing hat and provide sentence-level editing that enhances your book's flow, syntax, and clarity.
* A careful, considered response to your manuscript. More akin to the traditional editorial letter, this global feedback provides you with an assessment of the book's overall strengths and weaknesses, along with specific suggestions and solutions for revision.

After I submit first-pass edits to you, you'll have a chance to incorporate feedback and revise on your own. You'll then send the revised manuscript back to me for a final round of editing, which includes a copy edit. <mark>The fee for this service is $16 per page (1 page = 250 words).</mark>

### Line Editing

#### Intensive, line-by-line feedback and editing

I provide sentence-level editing that enhances your book's flow, syntax, and clarity. The goal of line editing is to leave you with a polished, publication-ready manuscript. <mark>My rates start at $12 per page (1 page = 250 words).</mark>

### Developmental Editing

#### Overall content feedback and revision strategy

Developmental editing assesses big-picture matters such as structure, organization, flow, pacing, plot, characterization, voice, tone, and consistency. I'll provide you with a detailed editorial letter that identifies your book's overall strengths and weaknesses, and guides you through the revision process using specific suggestions and solutions. <mark>Rates begin at $10 per page (1 page = 250 words).</mark>

### Book Proposal Preparation

#### Content strategy and marketing for nonfiction authors seeking traditional publication

The good news for nonfiction authors who want to publish with a trade publisher is that books are sold on proposal, rather than a completed manuscript. My Book Proposal Preparation service gives you a competitive proposal that's ready to submit to literary agents, acquisitions editors, and publishing houses. Components include:

<div class="scrunched">

* Your overview and hook
* Author bio
* Full marketing plan
* Competitive analysis
* Table of contents and chapter summaries
* 1-3 sample chapters

</div>

<mark>My rates start at $9,000. _To date, every client whose proposal has sold has recouped the cost of editing with their advance._ </mark>

### Manuscript Collaboration & Ghostwriting <br /> (nonfiction only)

If you have a great idea for a book but don't have the time, writing experience, or inclination to write it, let's work together to create a bestseller. You can write as much or as little as you like: I've worked with authors who provided 30 pages of content per chapter to authors who left all the writing and research to me (and everything in between).

I've written books in as little as four months, but generally, you should set aside around six months for the production of a manuscript of 60,000 â€“ 80,000 words, and slightly longer if you'd like a book proposal as well. Book Proposal Preparation + Manuscript Collaboration packages are available.

My rates are on the higher end of the professional ghostwriting scale, but can vary widely depending on the amount of work involved, the delivery deadline, and other negotiable terms such as profit-sharing and byline. (I do not require a byline and am happy to sign an NDA.) <mark>Please contact me for details and I'll provide you with a proposal outlining terms of service, deliverables, and fees.<mark>

### Consultation Hours

For writing or editing short works (articles, op-eds, chapters, query letters, etc.), or to consult me on matters related to publishing, <mark>I offer an hourly rate of $150.</mark>
